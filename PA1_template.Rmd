## Loading and preprocessing the data

### Unzip and read the data into R

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

### Check the data

```{r}
dim(activity)
str(activity)
head(activity)
```

### Convert the `date` varibale to `Date` format

```{r}
library(lubridate)
activity$date <- ymd(activity$date)
str(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### Caluculate total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
library(dplyr)
totalsteps_by_date <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Make the histogram

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
if (!file.exists("./figure")) {
    dir.create("./figure")
}
png("./figure/plot1.png")
ggplot(totalsteps_by_date, aes(total_steps)) +
    geom_histogram(breaks = seq(0, 22000, by = 1000), col = "black", alpha = .5) + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 22000, by = 2000)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 2)) + 
    labs(x = "Total steps (per day)", y = "Counts", title = "Distribution of Total Steps per Day")
dev.off()
```

### Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean <- round(mean(totalsteps_by_date$total_steps), 2)
median <- median(totalsteps_by_date$total_steps)
```

The **mean** of the total number of steps taken per day is **`r mean`**.  

The **median** of the total number of steps taken per day is **`r median`**.  


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

### Convert the `interval` variable to `Time` format

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(hms)
activity$interval <- activity$interval * 100
activity$interval <- sprintf("%06d", activity$interval)
activity$interval <- format(strptime(activity$interval, format = "%H%M%S"), format = "%H:%M:%S")
activity$interval <- as_hms(activity$interval)
str(activity)
```

### Calculate average daily steps by interval

```{r}
day_number <- length(unique(activity$date))
avesteps_by_interval <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(ave_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE)/day_number)
```

### Calculate the interval with maximum of average daily steps

```{r}
ave_steps_max <- max(avesteps_by_interval$ave_steps)
interval_max <- avesteps_by_interval %>% filter(ave_steps == ave_steps_max)
interval_max
```

### Make the plot

```{r}
png("./figure/plot2.png")
ggplot(avesteps_by_interval, aes(interval, ave_steps)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(interval_max[1, 1]), color = "red", alpha = .5) + 
    scale_x_time(breaks = c(as_hms("00:00:00"), as_hms("04:00:00"), as_hms("08:00:00"), as_hms("12:00:00"), 
                            as_hms("16:00:00"), as_hms("20:00:00"), as_hms("24:00:00"))) + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 200, by = 20)) + 
    labs(x = "5-Minutes Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps across All Days", 
         title = "The Average Daily Activity Pattern") + 
    geom_text(aes(x = as.numeric(interval_max[1, 1]), y = ave_steps_max, label = "(08:35:00, 179.1)", 
                  alpha = 0.5, color = "red"), hjust = -0.1, size = 4) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(interval_max[1, 1]), y = ave_steps_max, color = "red", alpha = 0.5), size = 1)
dev.off()
```

## Imputing missing values

### Check the number of `NAs` in `steps` variable

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

### Join `avesteps_by_interval` into the `activity` data frame

```{r}
activity_fixed <- full_join(activity, avesteps_by_interval, by = "interval")
```

### Replace `NA` in `steps` with the value in `ave_steps`

```{r}
activity_fixed <- mutate(activity_fixed, steps = coalesce(steps, ave_steps))
```

### Re-check the number of `NAs` in `steps` variable

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity_fixed$steps))
```

### Caluculate total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
totalsteps_by_date <- activity_fixed %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))
```

### Make the plot

```{r}
png("./figure/plot3.png")
ggplot(totalsteps_by_date, aes(total_steps)) +
    geom_histogram(breaks = seq(0, 22000, by = 1000), col = "black", alpha = .5) + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 22000, by = 2000)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 2)) + 
    labs(x = "Total steps (per day)", y = "Counts", title = "Distribution of Total Steps per Day")
dev.off()
```

![](./figure/plot3.png)

### Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean_n <- mean(totalsteps_by_date$total_steps)
median_n <- median(totalsteps_by_date$total_steps)
```

The **mean** of the total number of steps taken per day is **`r mean_n`**.  

The **median** of the total number of steps taken per day is **`r median_n`**.  


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### Create a new variable `weekdays`

```{r}
activity_fixed <- activity_fixed %>% mutate(weekdays = weekdays(date))
```

### Replace the values in weekdays to only "Weekday" or "Weekend"

```{r}
activity_fixed <- activity_fixed %>% mutate(weekdays = replace(weekdays, weekdays %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"), "Weekday"))
activity_fixed <- activity_fixed %>% mutate(weekdays = replace(weekdays, weekdays %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend"))
table(activity_fixed$weekdays)
```

### Convert `weekdays` to factor variable

```{r}
activity_fixed <- activity_fixed %>% mutate(weekdays = factor(weekdays))
```

### Calculate number of days in the Weekday and Weekend

```{r}
by_weekdays <- group_by(activity_fixed, weekdays)
no_weekdays <- summarise(by_weekdays, length(unique(date)))
no_weekdays
```

### Calculate average steps by interval and weekdays

```{r}
totalSteps_by_weekdays_interval <- activity_fixed %>% group_by(weekdays, interval) %>% summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))
aveSteps_by_weekdays_interval <- mutate(totalSteps_by_weekdays_interval, if (weekdays == "Weekday") {
    ave_steps = total_steps/45} else 
    {ave_steps = total_steps/16} 
)
colnames(aveSteps_by_weekdays_interval) <- c("weekdays", "interval", "total_steps", "ave_steps")
```

### Make the plot

```{r}
png("./figure/plot4.png")
ggplot(aveSteps_by_weekdays_interval, aes(interval, ave_steps)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(weekdays ~.) +
    labs(x = "5-Minutes Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps across All Days", 
         title = "The Average Daily Activity Pattern")
dev.off()
```
